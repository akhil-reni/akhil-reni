 # üìÑ Building a career in Cybersecurity - My thoughts! 

I have been working in cybersecurity domain for a very long time now, and I often get requests from friends and family on guiding them in building their cybersecurity career. 

In the past I have mentored a lot of people, helped them with jobs at my company @wesecureapp and as well as other big MNCs. During this phase, I also got an opportunity to explore things passively outside my organization, and I have been anyway actively participating in everything that's happening within my organization. This helped me to keep up with different cybersecurity trends, jobs and more.

The biggest question ATM and I frequently get asked is

### üöÄ Is cybersecurity a good career option and future? 
**Absolutely**. We have been seeing how tech and internet is being adopted globally and how many new tech/internet companies showed up in the last decade and likewise how many of them turned out to be unicorns. While there is tech, there is always a need to secure that tech. Unlike before 2015, today governments and different regulatory bodies have strict policies for companies to comply with certain security guidelines. Likewise, a lot of companies are also now taking the accountability for user data seriously. 

So today, a company when they start hiring they look for Developers, Quality analysts and even Security analysts/pentesters. Things changed. Now they want bug free software to go into production, but also they want secured software to be deployed.

## üèá Where do I start?

Like every other domain, it's often confusing, and we get lost figuring out where to start. Cybersecurity is an ocean and  there are a lot of things to pick from. 

If you're absolutely new and do not have any software or IT background as such, the first and foremost thing is to get yourself familiar with the basic networking stuff.

### üï∏Ô∏è Learn basic concepts of networking
Reference: [Free CCNA Tutorials. Study CCNA for free! (study-ccna.com)](https://study-ccna.com/)

In cybersecurity, it is  absolute necessary that your core concepts are really strong. Like for example, knowing how a network works,  OSI model, TCP/IP models, etc.

Getting a CCNA certification is optional, but completing the course will be really helpful. Most of the resources are freely available online and  doesn't take a lot of time to complete it. 

### üñäÔ∏è Learn security testing
My advice to all who are not book friendly, don't start your career by reading a book, instead do a live practical hack that will make you hyped up and motivated.

**Learn wireshark** - The most and easiest way to start and to challenge your knowledge in networking concepts is using wireshark and understanding what it does. Have you ever wondered if you're sibling is watching p*rn and you want to catch him red-handed? Or you want to sniff your relatives passwords? Well, wireshark is the way to go to capture unencrypted packets

**Learn Nmap** - Try to scan some devices on your network, may be the entire CIDR, see if anything open in general? Maybe the chromecast? Your smart Refrigerator?

**Learn Metasploit** - Spawn up some vulnerable VMs or containers and attack them using metasploit. [vulhub/vulhub: Pre-Built Vulnerable Environments Based on Docker-Compose (github.com)](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) Get those reverse shells. 

**Learn vulnerability scanners** - Learn how to use and run a vulnerability scanner. A good start would be using Nessus community edition. Run the scan on your home CIDR

**Learn Burp Suite** - Burp suite is like the go to tool if you want to test web applications.

### Other optional skills you can have 
- **Learn Linux**  - A lot of the times you'll end up on a black terminal. It's better to be familiar with most of the Linux tools, like for example, how to use vim, grep, networking commands (traceroute, dig, ipconfig etc), cut, cp, etc. [sudheerj/Linux-cheat-sheet: List of Linux commands (github.com)](https://github.com/sudheerj/Linux-cheat-sheet)
- **Learn how to script (optional)** - Creating an ability for yourself to write scripts in bash or python will be really helpful. Most of the boring stuff in your day-to-day life can be automated.
- **Basics of application development** - The way I started my career in appsec is through building apps. I built an app, broke it, and then fixed. This is the best way to know how things work on the other side. PHP is the easiest to learn, from plugging in a DB till making a small application live it will not take more than 1-2 hours.

## üìù Certifications
I am not a big certifications' fan, nor I hold any certifications, but the easiest way to clear round 1 in any interview or for any organization to find your profile easily online using few keywords is have to a certification, LOL! Here are some worthy certifications

In some countries certifications have a real different value, for example apparently getting a CREST certification is the real deal in Singapore. 

## ü§∫ Job roles
Like I said before, cybersecurity industry is an ocean. There are 100s of different job skills to pick from, some of my favourites and fun job roles are

#### Application security engineer/DevSecOps
Hands down the most fun job atm. This is an era of internet, applications, devops and cloud. Companies are building apps at lighting speed and deploying them at lighting speed. For security to keep up with such fast pace environments, it's always challenging and fun. Being an application security engineer your role would be helping organization deploy software, by implementing tools within CI/CD, helping developers write secure code, have a say in architecture decisions and more. There are so many fun industries, some of my personal favs are Fintech, it's fast pace and the requirement for compliance and other things make it even more fun!

[Application Security Engineer: Job Role and Key Skills for 2021 | Toolbox It-security](https://www.toolbox.com/it-security/application-security/articles/application-security-engineer-job-requirements-skills/)

***Should know***
- Basics of application development
- Scripting
- SDLC
- Secure code review
- Using tools like Burp suite
- Running automated vulnerability scanners
- Writing reports & documentation

#### Pentesting/Security Analyst
Pentesting jobs or security analyst jobs are mostly in service based organizations. If you love testing different type of environments, applications, networks and stuff, then this is the right job for you. I personally started off my career doing pentesting, and it was too much fun, it helped me explore soo many environments, that scaled my skills really quickly. If you're looking for this kind of job, always look towards a service based company. 

***Should know***
- Networking concepts
- Using tools like burp suite, Nmap, metasploit
- Scripting
- Writing reports & documentation
#### Red Teamer

Again, until and unless it's a large organization or a service based company, you'll not see such opportunities. For me, this is one of the exciting jobs because you have no scope, no boundaries. Just hit 'em hard. You're often to get work in active directory environments, or hybrid environments (cloud + on premise). Every red teaming objective is different, but the ultimate objective is getting the highest privilege on the network.

***Should know***
- Advanced networking concepts
- Advanced scripting like powershell, bash, python and more
- Active directory and hybrid cloud concepts
- Core Windows and Linux knowledge (depending on the environments)

#### Other job roles
- Incident response
- SOC analyst
- Threat analyst
- Reverse engineer

## Applying for jobs
Do active hunting till you find the job of your life! 

Make sure to write a fantastic and presentable resume. Your free time projects, freelancing stuff (if you ever did) and certifications, make sure everything is well presented on your resume.

Depending on location, experience and the job role, cybersecurity jobs are really well paid. Try to  scale up quickly in your career, especially in your 20s, with all that energy and time.
